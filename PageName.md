# Introduction #

This is a short collection of resources I've found useful for AVR Butterfly development.


# Details #

Atmel is of course a great reference for Atmel products.
  * [ATMega169 Product Card](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=3012) including several useful Application Notes.
  * [The ATMega169 datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2514.pdf)
  * [LCD details](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2530.pdf)
  * [Dataflash datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc3595.pdf)

Joe Pardue of [Smiley Micros](http://smileymicros.com) is a valuable Butterfly resource.
  * [Quick Start Guide - The Next Generation](http://www.smileymicros.com/Quick%20Start%20Guide%20-%20The%20Next%20Generation.pdf?&MMN_position=106:106) is a great introduction to the AVR Butterfly, a great start for a beginner and worth the read even if you are not.
  * [Butterfly Alternate Pin Uses](http://www.smileymicros.com/download/Butterfly%20Alternate%20Pin%20Uses.pdf?&MMN_position=62:62) Documentation of what the Butterfly's CPU's pins are connected to and Joe's notes about what you can and can't do with them.

[Martin Thomas' site](http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/) has many useful Butterfly links:
  * [AVR Butterfly Application code port to avr-gcc](http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/#bf_app), some pieces of which you will find in Butteruino.
  * [AVR Butterfly Bootloader code port to avr-gcc](http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/#bf_boot)
  * [AVRPROG compatible bootloader for ATMEL ATmega Controllers](http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/#avrprog_boot) This may be useful for making the Butterfly Arduino experience a little smoother.
  * [A Butterfly-based data logger](http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/bf_logger/index.html) possibly a source for inspiration and ideas.

Dean Camera has made available a remarkable amount of very useful information and code:
  * [AVR Articles](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/AVRArticles.php)
  * [AVR Experiments](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/CodeExperiments.php)

Arduino.cc Forums
  * [The Arduino.cc forums](http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl)
  * [A thread about using Arduino on the Butterfly](http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1222630663/0)

AVR Freaks:
  * [Dataflash](http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=42846) Details about how the dataflash on the butterfly works.
